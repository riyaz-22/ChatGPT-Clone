# ChatGPT-Clone


ChatGPT has gained significant popularity in recent months or years, completely changing how we interact with automated chatbots. As a beginner web developer, you might be curious about creating your own ChatGPT. The good news is that it is possible to create a ChatGPT clone using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

If you’re unfamiliar, ChatGPT is an advanced chatbot model developed by OpenAI. It uses artificial intelligence to generate human-like responses in a conversational format. ChatGPT has gained widespread popularity due to its ability to simulate natural conversations.

In this blog post, we will guide you through the steps of creating your very own ChatGPT using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By building a ChatGPT clone project, beginner web developers can gain practical experience by applying their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to real-world projects.

This ChatGPT clone project allows you to ask questions and receive instant responses. Additionally, you have the option to switch between dark and light themes. Your chat history is saved in the browser’s local storage, ensuring it remains even if you refresh the page. However, you can easily delete chats by clicking on the dedicated “Delete Chat” button.


To create your own ChatGPT using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, follow these step-by-step instructions:

Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js
Download and place the images folder in your project directory. This folder includes the user avatar and chatbot logo.
To start, add the following HTML codes to your index.html file: In this code snippet, you will find an empty “chat-container” div. We will later use JavaScript to dynamically add the “chat” div that will contain all the chat details.

Next, add the following CSS codes to your style.css file to apply visual styling to your ChatGPT interface. Now, if you load the web page in your browser, you will see ChatGPT displayed with a text input box and some icons at the bottom.


Finally, add the following JavaScript code to your script.js file. This script code will make your ChatGPT functional by enabling features such as chatting, switching between dark and light themes, and saving chat history in the browser.


Remember, your ChatGPT is not yet ready to generate chats based on prompts. To make it functional, you need to pay attention to a crucial detail in the code. Take a closer look, and you’ll notice that you have to paste an “OpenAI API key” into the API_KEY variable.

To get your API key, visit the following URL: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. Once there, log in to your account, and you will be able to generate a free API key. To understand other things in the code. I recommend watching the tutorial video, reading the code comments, and experimenting with the code.

” Remember that when you sign up for OpenAI, you’ll get a free $5 credit for your API usage. If your account is older than 3 months or the credit runs out, you’ll need a paid account or create a new one with a new number to keep using the API. Your API usage and expiration date can be found on the account’s usage page.”
